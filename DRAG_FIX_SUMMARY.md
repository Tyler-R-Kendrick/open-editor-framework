# Drag Functionality Fix & Regression Tests

## Problem Summary
The drag functionality had several critical issues:
1. **Corner-only dragging**: Components could only be dragged by clicking on corners instead of anywhere on the component
2. **0.5 second timeout**: Dragging would stop prematurely after ~500ms due to long press timer interference
3. **Custom implementation issues**: The custom drag code was conflicting with touch handling and had poor mobile support

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Replaced Custom Drag Code with @dnd-kit
- **Before**: Custom implementation using `@react-aria/dnd` with complex touch handling
- **After**: Modern `@dnd-kit` library providing:
  - Better touch support out of the box
  - More reliable drag detection
  - Proper accessibility features
  - Performance optimizations

### 2. Fixed Corner-Only Dragging Issue
**Root Cause**: The draggable overlay wasn't covering the entire component properly, and drag detection was inconsistent.

**Solution**:
```tsx
// Full-coverage drag handle overlay
<div
  style={{
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    bottom: 0,
    background: 'transparent',
    zIndex: 1
  }}
  aria-hidden="true"
/>
```

### 3. Eliminated Timeout Issues
**Root Cause**: Long press timers for context menus were interfering with drag operations.

**Solution**:
- Removed conflicting long press timers during drag operations
- Proper timer cleanup in `handleDragStart`
- Better separation between canvas touch handling and component dragging

### 4. Improved Touch Handling
**Key Improvements**:
- 8px activation distance to prevent accidental drags
- Proper multi-touch gesture handling
- Touch cancel event support
- Better pinch-to-zoom vs drag distinction

## Code Changes

### Main Implementation Files
- `src/components/editor-canvas/component.tsx` - Complete rewrite using @dnd-kit
- Added `DraggableComponent` and `DroppableCanvas` components
- Proper sensor configuration with `PointerSensor` and `KeyboardSensor`

### Key Features Added
1. **Drag Overlay**: Visual feedback during drag operations
2. **Bounds Constraints**: Components stay within canvas boundaries
3. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard support
4. **Touch Optimization**: Better mobile touch handling

## Regression Tests

Created comprehensive test suite in `__tests__/drag-regression.test.tsx`:

### Test Categories

#### 1. Prevent Corner-Only Dragging
- ✅ Entire component surface is draggable
- ✅ Center-click dragging works
- ✅ Multiple drag points tested
- ✅ Drag handle overlay covers full component

#### 2. Prevent Timeout Issues  
- ✅ No 500ms timeout interruption
- ✅ Continuous touch events work
- ✅ Long press timers are properly cleared
- ✅ Drag can continue indefinitely

#### 3. Touch Handling Reliability
- ✅ Single touch drag without interference
- ✅ Multi-touch vs drag gesture distinction
- ✅ Touch cancel event handling
- ✅ Pinch-to-zoom compatibility

#### 4. Library Integration (@dnd-kit)
- ✅ Proper DndContext usage
- ✅ Drag constraints within canvas bounds
- ✅ Visual feedback during drag
- ✅ Sensor configuration validation

#### 5. Accessibility & Performance
- ✅ ARIA labels for screen readers
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Event listener cleanup on unmount
- ✅ Memory leak prevention

## Installation Requirements

```bash
npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities
```

## Usage

The new drag functionality works out of the box:

1. **Click and drag** anywhere on a component to move it
2. **Touch and drag** on mobile devices  
3. **Keyboard accessibility** for screen reader users
4. **Visual feedback** during drag operations
5. **Automatic bounds constraints** keep components in canvas

## Testing

Run the regression tests:
```bash
npm test drag-regression.test.tsx
```

## Migration Benefits

1. **🎯 Reliable Dragging**: Works from anywhere on component, not just corners
2. **⏱️ No Timeouts**: Continuous drag for as long as needed
3. **📱 Better Mobile**: Improved touch handling and gesture recognition  
4. **♿ Accessible**: Screen reader and keyboard support
5. **🚀 Performance**: Optimized with proven library
6. **🧪 Tested**: Comprehensive regression test suite

## Future Considerations

1. **Long Press Actions**: Can be re-implemented using @dnd-kit's delay sensors
2. **Resize Handles**: Should be separate from drag functionality
3. **Multi-select Drag**: Can be added using @dnd-kit's multi-item support
4. **Custom Drag Previews**: Easy to implement with DragOverlay

This implementation provides a solid foundation for reliable drag functionality while preventing the regression of previous issues.
