# NPM Warnings Resolution

## Summary

This document tracks npm warnings and their resolution status.

## Resolved Warnings

### 1. EBADENGINE Warning
- **Issue**: npm version requirement was >=11.3.0 but system had 10.9.2
- **Resolution**: Updated npm to 11.4.2 using `npm install -g npm@latest`
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Pending Warnings (Indirect Dependencies)

These warnings come from indirect dependencies and cannot be directly fixed without updates from the upstream packages:

### 1. sourcemap-codec@1.4.8
- **Warning**: "Please use @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec instead"
- **Source**: vite-plugin-pwa@1.0.1 → workbox-build@7.3.0 → magic-string@0.25.9
- **Status**: ⏳ Waiting for vite-plugin-pwa update

### 2. inflight@1.0.6
- **Warning**: "This module is not supported, and leaks memory"
- **Sources**: 
  - style-dictionary@5.0.0 → patch-package@8.0.0 → rimraf@2.7.1 → glob@7.2.3
  - ts-jest@29.4.0 → @jest/transform@30.0.2 → babel-plugin-istanbul@7.0.0 → test-exclude@6.0.0 → glob@7.2.3
  - vite-plugin-pwa@1.0.1 → workbox-build@7.3.0 → glob@7.2.3
- **Status**: ⏳ Waiting for upstream updates

### 3. rimraf@2.7.1
- **Warning**: "Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported"
- **Source**: style-dictionary@5.0.0 → patch-package@8.0.0
- **Status**: ⏳ Waiting for style-dictionary update

### 4. glob@7.2.3
- **Warning**: "Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported"
- **Sources**: Multiple packages (see inflight sources above)
- **Status**: ⏳ Waiting for upstream updates

## Mitigation

1. **Created .npmrc file** with `loglevel=error` to suppress deprecation warnings during installation
2. **All direct dependencies are up-to-date** - these warnings come from transitive dependencies
3. **No security vulnerabilities** - npm audit shows 0 vulnerabilities

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for updates to:
   - vite-plugin-pwa (for sourcemap-codec fix)
   - style-dictionary (for rimraf and glob fixes)
   - ts-jest (for glob fix)

2. These deprecation warnings don't affect functionality and can be safely ignored until upstream packages update their dependencies.

## Running npm install without warnings

To install packages without seeing deprecation warnings:
```bash
npm install --loglevel=error
```

Or simply run `npm install` which will now use the .npmrc configuration.
