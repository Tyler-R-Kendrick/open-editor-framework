# Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring efforts to remove redundant code, use established libraries, and create smaller, self-contained components.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Replaced Custom Code with Established Libraries

#### useMediaQuery Hook

- **Before**: Custom implementation with manual event listeners
- **After**: Using `react-use` library's `useMedia` hook
- **Benefits**: Less code to maintain, battle-tested implementation

#### Touch Gesture Recognition

- **Before**: Custom `TouchGestureRecognizer` class with manual touch event handling
- **After**: Created `useGestures` hook using `@use-gesture/react` library
- **Benefits**: More robust gesture handling, better cross-browser support

#### Utility Functions

- **Added**: `lodash` for common utilities (debounce, throttle, clamp)
- **Added**: `classnames` for conditional CSS class handling
- **Benefits**: Industry-standard implementations, reduced custom code

### 2. Component Modularization

#### EditorCanvas Refactoring

The large monolithic `EditorCanvas` component (~864 lines) was broken down into:

1. **CanvasControls.tsx** (94 lines)
   - Isolated zoom/pan controls
   - Custom events: `onZoomIn`, `onZoomOut`, `onResetView`
   - Uses `classnames` for styling

2. **DraggableComponent.tsx** (92 lines)
   - Encapsulates draggable component logic
   - Custom events: `onSelect`, `onDoubleClick`
   - Better separation of concerns

3. **CanvasRenderer.tsx** (179 lines)
   - Handles all canvas drawing operations
   - Exposes ref methods for external control
   - Custom event: `onCanvasReady`

4. **useCanvasState.ts** (155 lines)
   - Custom hook for canvas state management
   - Events: `onZoomChange`, `onPanChange`, `onSelectionChange`
   - Includes gesture bindings

5. **Refactored component.tsx** (238 lines)
   - Now acts as a coordinator
   - Much cleaner and more maintainable

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

Each component now exposes custom events/hooks:

- Components communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Parent components can subscribe to child events
- Better testability and reusability

### 4. Removed Redundant Code

- Eliminated custom touch gesture recognition (~110 lines)
- Removed custom media query implementation (~15 lines)
- Simplified helpers.ts by removing redundant utilities
- Removed inline styles in favor of Tailwind CSS classes

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@use-gesture/react": "^10.3.0", // Gesture handling
  "classnames": "^2.5.1", // CSS class utilities
  "date-fns": "^3.6.0", // Date utilities
  "lodash": "^4.17.21", // General utilities
  "react-use": "^17.5.0" // React hooks collection
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Maintenance Burden**: ~200+ lines of custom code replaced with libraries
2. **Better Modularity**: Components are now 100-250 lines instead of 800+ lines
3. **Improved Reusability**: Components can be used independently
4. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller components are easier to test
5. **Better Performance**: Library implementations are optimized
6. **Type Safety**: All new components have proper TypeScript types

## Usage Example

```tsx
// Before: Everything in one component
<EditorCanvas theme="light" resolution={resolution} />

// After: Modular with event handlers
<EditorCanvas
  theme="light"
  resolution={resolution}
  showGrid={true}
  gridSize={20}
  onComponentSelect={(id) => console.log('Selected:', id)}
  onComponentEdit={(id) => openEditDialog(id)}
/>
```

## Next Steps

1. Apply similar refactoring to other large components
2. Create a component library with the modular pieces
3. Add unit tests for the new smaller components
4. Consider using React Context for shared state instead of Redux for some cases
